1. We have an input field for the user to enter a search term and a button to trigger the search.
2. When the "Search" button is clicked, it makes a request to the Wikipedia API, passing the search term as a query parameter.
3. The results are displayed below the search bar, with clickable links to the corresponding Wikipedia articles.
