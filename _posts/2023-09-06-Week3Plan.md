>>> How we plan to prepare for the PairShowcase

Here are some ways I can do that:

1. Read through the hacks for each section for this week.

2. Apply your current idea of the WeatherApp displaying your ability to interact with Python and Vscode.

3. Brainstorm ideas for what you should do for Javascript and Web interaction.

4. Brainstorm ideas for what you should do for linux and vscode interaction.

5. Implement respective ideas.

6. Check with Chatgpt incase debugging code is necessary. 

7. By the end of the week, finish programming projects and prepare to add as webpage (commit changes on github).
